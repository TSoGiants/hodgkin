# Project Hodgkin
Project Hodgkin is an open-source (semi) Arduino Nano-compatible microcontroller development board that is developed to IEC 60601 standards for 2xMOPP (methods of patient protection) isolation. It is intended for educational settings to enable students and enthusiasts to safely interface with biopotential amplifier circuits.

## About The Shoulders of Giants
In 1676, Isaac Newton, one of the most influential mathematicians and scientists of all time, famously wrote:

> "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."

The Shoulders of Giants, Inc. (TSoG) is a nonprofit (501(c)(3)) organization founded in 2013 on a vision that world-class science education should be available to all students of all ages. Since 2015, The Shoulders of Giants has offered an immersive, ongoing mentorship program for dedicated students who would like the opportunity to study more closely under the guidance of Dr. Steven J. Foland. This program is designed to provide middle and high school students with a broad foundation of knowledge and skills across science and engineering disciplines, experience working and communicating in a professional environment, and helps them develop the study habits necessary to achieve success at the university level and beyond.

In 2019, this world-class program became available to students everywhere with the launch of TSoG.tv. This online platform, created in collaboration between The Shoulders of Giants, Inc. and its sister-company Floating Point Laboratories, LLC, provides at-home exercises, live-streaming, and project support to students anywhere in the world.

## About #SBEE2020
Since 2015, The Shoulders of Giants has offered its flagship summer program, the Summer Biomedical Engineering Experience (SBEE) to high school students interested in exploring careers in biomedical engineering and related medical sciences. The original contents of the program were 60 hours of rigorous curriculum covering biomedical electronics, mechanical CAD and 3D printing, and microcontroller programming. Through this program, nearly 400 students have designed and built their own electromyograph (EMG) controlled prosthetic hands. 

In spring 2019, TSoG co-founder and Floating Point Laboratories managing director Dr. Steven J. Foland [announced an initiative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmPsDaRs3cc) to develop the SBEE curriculum into a TSoG.tv experience for students around the world in summer 2020. This has become known as the #SBEE2020 initiative. Dr. Foland hosted a successful 24-hour livestream fundraiser on June 29-30th 2019, teaching a prototype SBEE 2020 curriculum in one marathon session which can be viewed [here](https://www.tsogiants.org/2019/07/02/24-hour-challenge-physiological-signals-and-biomedical-electronics/). 

As of August 2019, development for SBEE 2020 is currently underway. In order to best serve the community, several new devices need to be developed to provide safe, affordable access to the technologies necessary for students to explore and interface with human biosignals. Among these are: Project Hodgkin, an inexpensive Arduino-compatible microcontroller development board built to follow IEC 60601 safety standards; and Project Huxley, a USB oscilloscope developed with biomedical applications and safety standards in mind.
